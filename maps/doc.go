/*
Package maps provides a set of generic functions for common operations on maps.

This package is a generated adapter that mirrors the public API of the standard
Go experimental package `golang.org/x/exp/maps`. It offers a convenient way
to access common utilities for cloning, extracting keys/values, and comparing maps.

For detailed information on the behavior of specific functions, please refer to
the official Go documentation for the `golang.org/x/exp/maps` package.
