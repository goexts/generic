/*
Package slices provides a rich set of generic functions for common operations on
slices of any element type.

This package is a generated adapter that mirrors the public API of the standard
Go experimental package `golang.org/x/exp/slices`. It offers a convenient way
to access common utilities for searching, sorting, and manipulating slices.

# Usage

## Mapping

`Map` creates a new slice by applying a function to each element of an original slice.

	type User struct{ ID int; Name string }

	func GetUserNames(users []User) []string {
		return slices.Map(users, func(u User) string { return u.Name })
	}

## Filtering

`Filter` creates a new slice containing only the elements that satisfy a predicate.

	type Product struct{ ID string; Price float64 }

	func FilterExpensiveProducts(products []Product, minPrice float64) []Product {
		return slices.Filter(products, func(p Product) bool { return p.Price >= minPrice })
	}

## Chaining Operations

You can chain operations like `Filter` and `Map` to build powerful data processing
pipelines.

	type Task struct{ ID int; Title string; Completed bool }

	func GetCompletedTaskTitles(tasks []Task) []string {
		// First, filter for completed tasks.
		completedTasks := slices.Filter(tasks, func(t Task) bool { return t.Completed })
		// Then, map the results to their titles.
		return slices.Map(completedTasks, func(t Task) string { return t.Title })
	}

## Performance Considerations

Functions like `Map` and `Filter` allocate new slices. To minimize allocations,
especially in performance-sensitive code, consider these strategies:

  - **Filter then Map**: Filtering first reduces the number of elements to be mapped.
  - **In-place modification**: For very large slices, you might modify the slice
    in-place instead of creating a new one, though this is often more complex.

For detailed information on the behavior of specific functions, please refer to
the pkg.go.dev documentation for the `slices` package.
