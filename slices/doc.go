/*
Package slices provides a rich set of generic functions for common operations on
slices of any element type.

This package is a generated adapter that mirrors the public API of the standard
Go experimental package `golang.org/x/exp/slices`. It offers a convenient way
to access these common utilities for searching, sorting, comparing, and
manipulating slices.

For detailed information on the behavior of specific functions, please refer to
the pkg.go.dev documentation for the `slices` package.
