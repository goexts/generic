/*
Package runes provides a rich set of functions for the manipulation of rune slices (`[]rune`).

This package is essential for correct, Unicode-aware text processing at the
code point level. It is a generated adapter that mirrors the public API of the
Go experimental package `golang.org/x/text/runes`, offering convenient access
to its specialized utilities.

For detailed information on the behavior of specific functions and the underlying
Unicode algorithms, please refer to the official documentation for the
`golang.org/x/text/runes` package.
